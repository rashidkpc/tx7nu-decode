# tx7nu-decode

This is an incredibly simplistic decoder for the La Cross TX7NU 433mhz weather station. 
The code is intentionally very verbose. It could easily be modified to work with anything that uses the same sort
of keying and pulse length modulation. It currently prints to the console, but could obviously be alternated to do, well, whatever with the data.

I don't support this at all, clearly. It is for demonstration purposes. I mostly put it in a repo to keep myself from losing it in a gist.
There is no Makefile, if you don't know how to build it, you definitely don't need it.
